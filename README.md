# devCA

This is a full-stack application created for the purpose of displaying popularity of various technologies across Canada (e.g. Python, C++). Data is scraped from job search engine Adzuna, and is subsequently stored, from which it may be served to the client.

The backend for the app is built in Python, and has two primary functionalities. The first being a scraper, which makes heavy use of the Beautiful Soup library. The second is a Flask app that serves the scraped data to the client.

The frontend is created using Typescript/React, with the primary feature being a choropleth map (react-leaflet) that visualizes the data by region. There are also smaller visualizations that make use of the Recharts library.

The client is hosted at: https://client.devcanada.online/

At the current moment the full application is NOT live. 

I have intentionally throttled the scraper as to respect the Adzuna servers. As a result, the runtime of the scraper exceeds the maximum timeout of a serverless function. This means in order to serve the app, I had to deploy it on a server, which required $$$$. 

Anyway, thank you for checking out my project! If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
